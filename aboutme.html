        Hello, thanks for reading this little blurb about me. I grew up in California until I was 30, and then moved to Seattle. I have been a Bartender for 10+ years and during the pandemic made the decision to switch to a new coding career. 
        I did some research and landed on FreeCodeCamp as my bootcamp, and have gotten far using that for my primary education.I have primarily focused my education on React, making it a point to learn current standards as well as legacy styles. In the process I've become familiar with the full stack process, 
        including utilizing the Github cli to automate my page updates through netlify.  To suppllement the education from freecodecamp, i have used courses from Scrimba, CodeDojo, as well as codewars' weekly challenges. I feel as though my many 
        years of bartending give me an edge over some other beginning developers because of the patience and social skills required to handle day to day operations in that environment.      <br/><br/>
