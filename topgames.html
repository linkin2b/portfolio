    <h3> Site utilizing apis to fetch game listings based on weekly sales</h3>
    
    <p>I wanted to show my ability to utilize apis and fetch a fresh listing of games from Steam servers. <br/>
        The hardest part of this project was learning how to hide the api key and login info while still having the site function.</p>
